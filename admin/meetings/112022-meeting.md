## Agenda
1. Look over everyone's progress
2. Give suggestions to each other & share new ideas
3. TA joins at 8:30
    - discuss grading rubric, expectations for the project
    - show TA our current website progress

## New Ideas
- From Yash: add team page to our website (Alessia & Spencer will convert our team.md into an html page)
- From Yash: we could have a archive budget page so we can make new budgets but don't have to delete old budgets
- From Alessia: incorporate function for when users receive instead of spend money

## Grading Rubric (Required Components)
As suggested by our TA.

- every file name needs to be meaningful; has to convey the idea behind the file
- every file should contain a comment on top / header (3-4 lines) about what the file does (functionality, why we have this file)
- every function name needs to be meaningful
- every variable name needs to be meaningful
  - points will be reduced if there are things like x = 4
  - i in for-loops are fine but if we're using the variable to store data the name should be sth easy to understand
- follow the Camel Case Convention
- clean, readable code (having function headers, comments)
  - when defining a function, make sure there are comments above the function specifying what the parameters mean, exepcted output & type of output
    - see examples on GeeksForGeeks
  - whenever making a decision or using logic (ex. finding out minimum element within an array) it should also be documented in comments
  - good coding style
- unit tests should cover all possible scenarios
  - Example Format:
    - Test Case 1:
    
      Results:
     
      Expected Results:
      
      // screenshots
      
  - write down our thought processes
  - 1 file (multiple test cases) for each component
  - test every functionality instead of every single function

## Other Expectations
As suggested by our TA.

- make sure to read the assignments on Canvas very cautiously & incorporate everything in our project. every line & expectations discussed by the prof are things they will consider when grading
- be proactive in discussing deadlines & things due soon with the TA in meetings; they want to see our proactiveness
- can @ TA in groupchat after submitting an assignment for her to check before the deadline
- try to get feedback from our TA early on so we have time to make changes before deadlines
- our TA will be checking our commit histories (if paired programming then it's ok if some ppl don't have commits), task distributions, individual participations, and standups to grade everyone, so we might not all get the same grades

## Project Suggestions from TA
- Reminders: be able to drag items to rearrange, or sort based on importance
- Visualization: show % instead of amount on pie chart
