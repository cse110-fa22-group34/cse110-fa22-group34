## Agenda
1. Looked over everyone's progress
2. Suggestions time

## New Ideas
- From Yash: we could have a archive budget page so we can make new budgets but don't have to delete old budgets
- From Yash: add team page to our website (Alessia will convert our team.md into an html page)

## Grading Rubric (Components)
- every file name needs to be meaningful; has to convey the idea behind the file
- every file should contain a comment on top / header (3-4 lines) about what the file does (functionality, why we have this file)
- every function name needs to be meaningful
- every variable name needs to be meaningful
  - points will be reduced if there are things like x = 4
  - i in for-loops are fine but if we're using the variable to store data the name should be sth easy to understand
- follow the Camel Case Convention
- clean, readable code (having function headers, comments)
  - when defining a function, make sure there are comments above the function specifying what the parameters mean, exepcted output & type of output)
    - see examples on GeeksForGeeks
  - whenever making a decision or using logic (ex. finding out minimum element within an array) it should also be documented in comments
