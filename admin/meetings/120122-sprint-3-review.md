## Stand-Ups
This week's sprint was all about fixing coding errors for our budget website or adding documentation and unit testing depending on each pair's progress. We did Stand-Ups as both pairs and individuals as the work was divided among pairs.

### Alessia & Spencer:
- Fixed all the colors to be less green overall easier on the eye
- Add a default view for text view that shows how much money they have left per day
- Created the show more and show less button for reminders and calendar
- Made the visualization bigger when reminders and calendar is hidden and smaller when shown
- Finalized any comments and documentations
