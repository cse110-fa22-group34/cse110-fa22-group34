### User centered design
 - users highly focus on saving money so the social part would be used to encourage sharing budget-saving techniques
 - apply direct manipulation in interface design so that users can skip the process of selecting colors or category themselves
 - the interface design should be clear and concise so that the user experience can be ensured

Decided from a list of ideas that our project would be a website budgeter. The domain of the project is personal finance
