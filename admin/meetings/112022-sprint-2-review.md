## Stand-Ups
This week's sprint was all about coding the back end of our budget website. We did Stand-Ups as both pairs and individuals as the work was divided among pairs. Each pair presented their code and we took appropriate documentation so we could review. Our TA joined the meeting at 8:30 PM and gave us many suggestions that we will take into account and make changes accordingly for our third sprint meeting.

### Alessia (on behalf of Spencer):
- Fixed colors and made color layout correct, worked on Team Page HTML and style sheet

### Sisy & Yash:
- Implemented the JavaScript of the calendar, have real time dates on the calendar, include previous/next buttons that navigate through different months of the calendar

### Raphael & Xu:
- Deleted the view chart button now as user change the option the image displays itself

### Jiaxin & Derrick:
- Implemented the add row and delete row feature
- Implemented the feature when we click “create new budget”, an empty expense table will be displayed
- Implemented the feature when we click “delete budget”, all the existing data in the expense table will be cleared
- Specified the type of each input entry: date for the date column, number for the cost column, text for the item column, a dropdown selection menu for the label column
