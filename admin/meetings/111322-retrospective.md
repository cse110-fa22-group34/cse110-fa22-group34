# Actions: 

1. Time takes for meetings: Have a set meeting time for each meeting we plan

2. Merging of the code: Everyone will work in separate files to avoid interference

3. Plan for the coding was not specific enough and lead to confusions: Describe coding projects more so that people have a better idea on where to start

4. Certain functions are not implemented correctly: ask for help from other group members and potentially seek help from TA

5. Deadlines: Update our timeline to include checkpoints 

6. Behind on Important Decisions: More clear documentation and for people to understand documentation before writing any code.

7. Inefficient meetings, Lack of Planning/Preparation: Make a weekly reminders list and an outline for important meeting talking points
